                <h3>Genshin Impact [a] is an action role-playing game developed and published by miHoYo (with publishing
                    outside mainland China under Cognosphere, d/b/a HoYoverse). It was released for Android, iOS,
                    PlayStation 4, and Windows in 2020, and for PlayStation 5 in 2021, with an Xbox Series X/S version
                    coming in November 2024. The game features an anime-style open world environment and an action-based
                    battle system using elemental magic and character-switching. A free-to-play game monetized through
                    gacha
                    game mechanics, Genshin Impact is updated regularly using the games as a service model.</h3>

                <div class="insidetipstxt2">
                    <h1>What's Natlan?</h1><br><br>

                    <h3>Natlan is located on the other side of Sumeru's desert region, the Great Red Sand. It is also
                        home
                        to
                        natural hot springs created from volcanic activity.[1][2] Its people are grouped into tribes,
                        and
                        each
                        tribe follows different rules.[3] During Tenoch's era, which happened prior to the creation of
                        Mare
                        Jivari over 1,000 years ago, there were at least six major tribes in Natlan, of which all are
                        extant
                        by
                        the time the Traveler arrives there.[4]<br><br>

                        According to Neuvillette, dragons in Natlan, called Saurians, have undergone long-term
                        development
                        and
                        evolution with a large number of them coexisting with humanity. He also details that war is a
                        constant
                        in Natlan that ravages the land like an undying flame. Il Capitano, the First of the Eleven
                        Fatui
                        Harbingers, was also noted to be present in the region participating in the
                        conflicts.[5]<br><br>

                        According to Ranjit, people in Natlan have a lot of reservations about leaving their homeland,
                        but
                        he
                        doesn't feel comfortable talking about it as a foreigner. He does not believe it is due to a
                        fear of
                        unfamiliar environments.[6] On the other hand, Mavuika states that the reason is due to the
                        people's
                        survival being tied with the Wayob against the Abyss; even if left with no choice, those
                        departing
                        Natlan must seek their tribal chief's approval with the Wayob in order to grant them leave.[7]

                <h2>What to do first in Genshin Impact</h2>
                <h3>If you're just starting out your journey in Teyvat, we suggest playing through as much of the story
                    as you can first (this is called the Archon Quest), and getting to at least Adventure Rank 12, as
                    this is when Daily Commissions unlock.</h3>
                <img src="genshinassets/images (2).jpg" class="tipsimgmod1">
                <h3>Complete four of these purple-coloured quests everyday and claim your rewards from Katheryne.
                    Commissions are your daily source of Primogems, the primary currency used to buy Fate, which is used
                    for rolling for new characters or weapons through the gacha system. Daily Commissions are also a
                    great source of Adventure EXP, which is needed to raise your Adventure Rank in order to take part in
                    story missions and limited-time events.
                    <br><br>
                    Opening any chests you come across and activating Teleport Waypoints and Statue of the seven is also
                    recommended, as they
                    both give you Primogems, and Teleport Waypoints make travelling a lot easier.

                <br><br><br><br>
                <h2>What to do daily in Genshin Impact?</h2>
                <h3>We've got more information on what these activities mean below, but in general here's everything you
                    can do daily in Genshin Impact:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Daily Commissions</li><br>
                        <li>Expeditions</li><br>
                        <li>Spending Original Resin : by doing artifact domain(if you're on adventure rank 45), weekly
                            boss, ley line and material domains</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Daily battle pass challenges</li>
                    </ul>
                    Logging in to HoYoLAB for free rewards
                    Apart from the HoYoLAB login and Original Resin (which replenishes once every eight minutes), the
                    rest of these daily activities reset at 4am (server time) every day.You don't have to do all of
                    these activities in one day, but if you want to make sure you're not missing out on any rewards, you
                    should aim to do most of them. If you want to save time, then we recommend dropping spending
                    Original Resin, as it takes longer than all the other activities combined.

                <br><br><br><br>
                <h2>How to level up characters in Genshin Impact</h2>
                <h3>There are technically a few ways to level up your characters in Genshin Impact, but you should only
                    really use one of them. While you can raise a character's EXP by defeating enemies, bosses, and
                    completing certain quests, it's a ridiculously low amount compared to the best method.
                    <br><br>
                    The best way to level up characters in Genshin Impact is to use EXP books called Wanderer's Advice,
                    Adventurer's Experience, and Hero's Wit.
                </h3>
                <img src="genshinassets/How-to-level-up-characters-in-Genshin-Impact-1.webp" alt="upgrade material"
                    class="tipsimgmod1">
                <br><br>
                <h3>Purple books are the best character EXP sources.
                    Here's how much EXP you get from using one of each:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wanderer's Advice - 1,000 EXP</li>
                        <li>Adventurer's Experience - 5,000 EXP</li>
                        <li>Hero's Wit - 20,000 EXP</li>
                    </ul>
                    For comparison, defeating a regular enemy usually only gives your character 14 EXP.

                    These EXP books are usually rewarded in limited-time events, but you can also get them from playing
                    the game. Completing quests, opening chests, and taking part in the Blossom of Revelation Leyline
                    recurring event (the blue, foggy circle symbol on your map) are some of the best ways of getting EXP
                    books.

                <h2>Genshin Impact tips, tricks</h2>
                <br><br>
                <h3>There are some things that are good to know that aren't as essential as the explainers we have
                    above, but will make your time exploring Teyvat a lot easier, especially at the beginning of the
                    game.

                    Here's some tips and tricks for Genshin Impact that we wish we knew before starting:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use HoYoLab site or app - You can log in daily or complete special online activities for
                            free
                            rewards like Primogems, Mora, and level up materials.</li>
                        <br><br>
                        <li>Don't forget to cook - Meals heal characters and raise attack, defence, and critical hit
                            stats. Some
                            characters will even give you more food, or return resources if you select them in the
                            cooking menu.</li><br><br>
                        <li>Use Statues of Seven - These are where you fast travel to instantly heal your party, or
                            bring
                            'oculus' collectibles found floating every region. These are the green 'Anemoculus' in
                            Mondstadt,
                            and giving them to statues in the Mondstadt will give you rewards, including increasing your
                            stamina.</li><br><br>
                        <li>Don't leave anything behind - Everything dropped by an enemy can be used to upgrade
                            characters and
                            weapons, and anything found in the environment can be used in cooking, crafting, or
                            sometimes even
                            to level up your characters.</li><br><br>
                        <li>Create an exploration team - Throughout the regions, you'll come across small environmental
                            puzzles
                            that require you use a specific element or weapon type. The recommended elements to bring in
                            your
                            party change with each region, but having an archer is always recommended. Some characters
                            also mark
                            Ascension materials on your map, an incredibly useful skill when farming for them.</li>
                        <br><br>
                        <li>Use the Adventure's Handbook - This book gives you a good set of goals to work towards at
                            the
                            beginning, but will also tell you where to find specific types of enemies. This is useful if
                            you
                            need to farm resources and are looking for enemies that drop them</li><br><br>
                        <li>Follow the floating blue Seelies for hidden rewards - These ghost-looking creatures are
                            found
                            all over the map and will lead you to hidden chests.</li><br><br>
                        <li>Don't spend Primogems on Aquaint Fate - It's Intertwined Fate you need to Wish for the
                            event
                            characters, and Acquaint for the permanent Banner available. While the permanent character
                            and
                            weapon Banner does have good characters on it, they're also included on event Banners,
                            meaning
                            you will get them eventually just by wishing on the event character Banners with Intertwined
                            Fate.</li><br><br>
                        <li>5-Star characters and weapons aren't automatically better than 4-Stars - It's all about
                            making
                            the best teams that work well together in Genshin Impact. A team of 4-Stars who create more
                            damage by activating and combining elements or healing and shielding is far more desirable
                            than
                            only using a 5-Star with good damage numbers but lacklustre support from the rest of the
                            team.
                            With weapons, it's usually best to look at the bonus it gives rather than its raw stats.
                        </li><br><br>
                        <li>Use custom map icons - Using these icons can save you a lot of time when farming for
                            materials!
                            Following a guide will help, but nothing beats following your own markers, as they appear on
                            your mini-map. It's also great for marking good mining or food item areas.</li><br><br>
                        <li>Don't ignore events - Events are limited-time quests that offer a lot of rewards, including
                            free
                            characters sometimes. Once they're over you can't claim any of their rewards, however, so
